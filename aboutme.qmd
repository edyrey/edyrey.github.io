---

I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate statistics major pursuing a minor in economics at Cal Poly. As I enter my final year of my undergraduate education, I am continuously driven by my passion for data management, data cleaning, and creating efficient data workflows that lead to insightful visualizations. My goal is to pursue a career as a data analyst, where I can apply my skills and creativity to uncover valuable insights from complex datasets.

As I prepare to transition into the professional world, I am actively seeking opportunities where I can work collaboratively within a team environment. I am enthusiastic about contributing to and learning from a group of dedicated professionals, and I am committed to continuous growth and knowledge-sharing with my peers. My goal is to find a role that not only challenges me but also allows me to grow alongside others in a dynamic and supportive setting.

What excites me most about data management and visualization is the potential to make a significant impact. I believe that well-designed visualizations have the power to transform data into actionable insights, enabling individuals and organizations to make informed decisions. I am motivated to use my skills and passion to engage and inform others through compelling data visualizations.

Outside of academia, I find solace and inspiration in nature. Hiking, mountain biking, and climbing are my favorite outdoor activities, allowing me to connect with the beauty of the natural world. Growing up, my family instilled in me a love for adventure and exploration, which continues to fuel my desire to seek new experiences and broaden my horizons.

I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to leveraging my knowledge and passion for data management and visualization to contribute meaningfully to the field.
