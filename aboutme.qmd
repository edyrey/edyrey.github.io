I am currently a second-year undergraduate statistics major with a minor in economics at Cal Poly. As I enter my third year, I am driven by my passion for data management, data cleaning, and creating efficient data workflows that lead to insightful visualizations. My goal is to pursue a career as a data analyst, where I can apply my skills and creativity to uncover valuable insights from complex datasets.

Throughout my academic journey, I have actively sought opportunities to gain practical experience in data management and visualization. I am currently working on a project with a professor where I focused on data cleaning and analysis. I have successfully completed coursework focused on advanced data visualization techniques. Additionally, I am proud of my achievements in creating interactive dashboards that effectively communicate complex information in a user-friendly manner.

What excites me most about data management and visualization is the potential to make a significant impact. I believe that well-designed visualizations have the power to transform data into actionable insights, enabling individuals and organizations to make informed decisions. I am motivated to use my skills and passion to engage and inform others through compelling data visualizations.

Outside of academia, I find solace and inspiration in nature. Hiking, mountain biking, and climbing are my favorite outdoor activities, allowing me to connect with the beauty of the natural world. Growing up, my family instilled in me a love for adventure and exploration, which continues to fuel my desire to seek new experiences and broaden my horizons.

I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to leveraging my knowledge and passion for data management and visualization to contribute meaningfully to the field.
