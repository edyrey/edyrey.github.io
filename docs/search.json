    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently graduated from Cal Poly with a B.S. in Statistics and a minor in Economics, and I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills in data analysis, workflow automation, and visualization. I’m particularly passionate about data cleaning and building efficient, reliable pipelines that lead to clear and actionable insights.\nAs I transition into the professional world, I am actively seeking opportunities where I can work collaboratively within a team environment. I am enthusiastic about contributing to and learning from a group of dedicated professionals, and I am committed to continuous growth and knowledge-sharing with my peers. My goal is to find a role that not only challenges me but also allows me to grow alongside others in a dynamic and supportive setting.\nWhat excites me most about data management and visualization is the potential to make a significant impact. I believe that well-designed visualizations have the power to transform data into actionable insights, enabling individuals and organizations to make informed decisions. I am motivated to use my skills and passion to engage and inform others through compelling data visualizations.\n\nOutside of academia, I find solace and inspiration in nature. Hiking, mountain biking, and climbing are my favorite outdoor activities, allowing me to connect with the beauty of the natural world. Growing up, my family instilled in me a love for adventure and exploration, which continues to fuel my desire to seek new experiences and broaden my horizons.\nI am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to leveraging my knowledge and passion for data management and visualization to contribute meaningfully to the field."
